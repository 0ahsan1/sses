                                            The system operates on power generated using solar PV (photovoltaic) system. The photovoltaic array converts the solar energy into electricity, which is used for running the motor pump set. The pumping system draws 
                                            water from the open well, bore well, stream, pond, canal etc.

                                            Because solar systems only operate during daylight hours the water pumped out is typically stored in a storage tank for use 24 hours per day, to ensure constant availability of water. The tank capacity should be designed to allow for rainy or cloudy days (no sun days) when pumping will be limited. The size and dimensions of the storage tank is determined based on the required number of day’s storage. If large storage tanks are impractical, back up batteries or a generator can also be incorporated in the design to allow for prolonged periods of no 
                                            sun days that will eventually empty the water storage tank.

                                            Pumping can be by submersible pumps, commonly used for deeper wells, where surface pumps cannot be used because the water level is too deep below ground level (below approximately 6 meters depth). These borehole pumps are specially designed to have a small outside diameter so they can be suspended below the water level in the well and connected to an output pipe that extends up to the surface. The right pump for each application will depend on the requir
                                            ed pumping rates and pumping height and distance.

                                            Alternatively, surface pumps are used to move water from sources such as shallow wells, ponds, streams, and tanks, where the pump itself can be located no more than 6 meters above the water level. There are many types of pump available; the choice will depend on how much water per day needs to be moved and the height and distance to the delivery point (such as the storage tank). Pump efficiency and reliability can be
                                             improved if suction lift can be minimized to just a few meters.

                                            Getting the most benefit from solar water pumping systems requires research and design before the first PV module and a pump is purchased and installed. Each component must be carefully matched, and proper planning is essential – so the final system will be efficient and reliable and can function for many years to come.

These systems do not need batteries and use common solar inverters and are connected to the public electricity grid. Any excess solar power that you generate is exported
                                             to the electricity grid and you usually get paid a feed-in-tariff (FiT) or credits for the energy you export.
