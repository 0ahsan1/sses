Mr. Sardar Akhtar Mengal (Member of National Assembly, Pakistan) sponsored this project for the poor people of this small village Kangoori, which is located near Shah Noorani Dargah Balochistan. SSES successfully completed this project within two days despite its remote location. All the safety measures were taken and SOPs were strictly followed as this project was installed during the corona pandemic days.

SP 60 Pump of 10 HP was used for this project which delivers around 1200 liters/minute flow from 4 inch delivery at 80 feet head. The owner of this land used to operate a petrol engine to drive the pump. The petrol engine consumed 50 liters of fuel per day. This Solar water pumping system saved fuel cost of approximately 5,000 Rs per day for the land lord and the Return of Investment (ROI) for this project is only 6 months.

SSES won this tender of installation of Solar Water Pumping System for Overhead Tank of University at <b>“Lasbela University of Agriculture, Water and Marine Sciences Uthal, Balochistan”</b> by submitting the lowest bid. The university authorities were very much concerned due to shortage of water at the university. Due to excessive load shedding the pumps which are used to fill the overhead tank of the university remained nonoperational which was the main cause of water shortage. Team SSES installed a Solar Water Pumping which resolved this problem. Prof. Dr. Dost Muhammad Baloch highly praised the efforts of team SSES when he came to visit the project site.

                    This is a 9 kW Solar On-Grid System which was installed by SSES at Gulshan e Maymar, Karachi. This system is running all the load of the house on Solar Power at day time and exporting the surplus energy generated to the grid. Client is very happy with the project and gave us a very positive feedback. Client observed a major reduction in electricity bill due to which the return of investment (ROI) will be within 3 years.

                    This is 24 kW solar on-grid system installed at Mr. Qayyum’s House which is opposite to Agha Khan Hospital Karachi. We have used elevated mounting structure for solar panels which is specially designed to bear all the load of solar panels and is strong enough to sustain in earthquakes and high speed winds. Elevated structure does not acquires any roof space and also provides shadow which keeps the roof and hence the house cool. 24kW on-grid system is producing approx. 2,500-3,000 Units (kWh) monthly. These units are used to fulfil the house electricity requirements and the excess solar energy generated is exported to grid via two way meter which is installed by K Electric. This system has lowered the electricity bill of this house up to 90 %. The ROI is expected within 2.5 years.

                    This is a 5 kW Solar Off-Grid System which was installed by SSES on 25th July, 2019 at Azeem Town, Near Safoora Chowrangi, Karachi. At the time of this project, Azeem Town was a newly started housing scheme which was in the development phase. There was no grid electricity present. We provided a 24 hours Solar Off-Grid Solution which not only fulfilled their electricity needs but also saved the cost of running generator for 24 hours which is at least 5,000 rupees saving per day.
